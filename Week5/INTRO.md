#### Introduction:
As a foreigner working/studying in Taipei (Taiwan) with little knowledge of Chinese, I face a lot of difficulties in understand the city and its people. With the power of Python, I will try to explore how things locate in this city.

#### Method:
~~~
+ Get the location data
+ Geocode it into lat, lon
+ Use Foursquare to examine each neighborhood
+ Cluster the neighborhood using KNN
~~~
#### I will make two attemps: one for all venues category and one for restaurant only (because we all love food).
