## Data
##### The easiest location of each areas is the post office representing that neighborhood. In this part I use pandas to read the data from Postal location of Taipei city
##### from https://www.post.gov.tw/post/internet/index.jsp
##### The result of the data without geocoding is taipei_add.csv
## Geocode the data
##### Due to some difficulties to find API geocode, I do not present the code here to get the lat, lon of the venues. Also, the length of the data is cut down to 48.
##### The lat, lon data are shown in taipei_add_geocode.csv
